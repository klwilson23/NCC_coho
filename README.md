# Using fisheries risk assessment to inform precautionary and collaborative management in a declining coho salmon fishery

Repository to support Bayesian hierarchical time-series analysis for North and Central Coast Coho Salmon since 1980

Summary
The conservation and management of Pacific salmon in Canada faces an uncertain future. While policies, like Canadaâ€™s Wild Salmon Policy, increasingly embrace collaborative governance, salmon continue to decline because of climate changes and overfishing that require precautionary management. We quantified spatial-temporal patterns in population dynamics for 52 coho salmon populations along the North and Central Coast of British Columbia since 1980 to determine population status, assess risks posed by a mixed-stock fishery that spans U.S., Canadian, and Indigenous jurisdictions, and implement forward simulations of alternative productivity trends and harvest scenarios to inform management. Overall, we found declining abundances for 51% of coho populations since 2017 that were driven by productivity regime shifts associated with recent marine heatwaves. Although long-term coho recovery depended on future productivity trends, reduced harvest rates across U.S. and Canadian jurisdictions can improve short-term recoveries. While rebuilding coho will depend largely on whether productivity improves, harvest management remains one of the few tools available to provide a safe operating space for coho populations, and their fisheries, to adapt to ongoing ecosystem changes.
